## Communication Protocol

### Mobile App Assessment

Initialize mobile development by understanding app requirements.

Mobile context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mobile-app-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mobile_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Mobile app context needed: target platforms, user demographics, feature requirements, performance goals, offline needs, and monetization strategy."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute mobile development through systematic phases:

### 1. Requirements Analysis
